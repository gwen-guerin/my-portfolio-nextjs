            Hi, I'm Gwen, I'm 27. I've had a lot of different jobs experiences.
            Lately i've discovered programming. I fell in love and now I know
            what I want to do of my life.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I've started to learn HTML & CSS on my own, pushed by a family
            member. My brother in law is a developer and helped me a lot to start, to know
            where to go and what this was about. With the Covid, I struggled to
            find a job with nearly no experience and no degree. So I decided to
            turn to an intensive course. That's when I was accepted to the
            Bootcamp La Capsule.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Freshly graduated, I am now, looking for a job, and keen as ever !
